# linear_regression

**Definition:** The correlation coefficient is a measure that quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1.

**Interpretation:**

A correlation coefficient close to +1 indicates a strong positive relationship, meaning as one variable increases, the other variable tends to also increase.
A coefficient close to -1 indicates a strong negative relationship, where as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.
A coefficient close to 0 suggests little to no linear relationship between the variables.

**Usage:** In machine learning, understanding the correlation between variables helps in feature selection and understanding which variables might be redundant or highly influential in predicting the target variable.
