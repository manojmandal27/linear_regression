# linear_regression

**Definition:** The correlation coefficient is a measure that quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1.

**Interpretation:**

A correlation coefficient close to +1 indicates a strong positive relationship, meaning as one variable increases, the other variable tends to also increase.
A coefficient close to -1 indicates a strong negative relationship, where as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.
A coefficient close to 0 suggests little to no linear relationship between the variables.

**Usage:** In machine learning, understanding the correlation between variables helps in feature selection and understanding which variables might be redundant or highly influential in predicting the target variable.

The correlation coefficient r between two variables 𝑋  and 𝑌  is computed using the following formula:

The correlation coefficient 𝑟 between two variables 𝑋  and 𝑌 can also be expressed in terms of their covariance and standard deviations (or variances). Here's the equation:

This formula calculates the correlation coefficient 𝑟, which ranges between -1 (perfect negative correlation) and +1 (perfect positive correlation). A correlation coefficient close to 0 indicates little or no linear relationship between the variables 𝑋 and 𝑌.
